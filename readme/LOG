12/5
- Instead of using my own file format to store recipes, I am now using JSON.
- Converted my recipe base to a JSON recipe base
- Modified parse code to read off the JSON
- Read a little bit of Russel and Norvig on classical planning.
  While reading, I mostly gathered that I already have this understanding --
  from papers that I have read on CBR in AI.  I didn't learn of any better
  representation of a plan than a list of actions.

- Mood: Just Do Something.  I am picking a representation for plans, since
  it doesn't matter too much right now what it is (so long as it can be
  used for case adaptation).  So here is our official plan representation:

  The world is described by its *state*, which is just a setting of variables
  to values.

  We can perform an *action* a: S1 -> P -> S2 from state to state, where
  	S1 is the *input state*, whose variables satisfy certain *preconditions*
  	P are the *parameters*
  	S2 is the *result state*, and reflects the *effects* of 'a'.

  A *plan* is simply an array of actions: [a1, a2, a3, ..., an], where all
  of the preconditions of the actions are satisfied, a1 is applied to the
  *initial state*, and the actions in sequence result in the *final state*.

- Wrote down the representation of case adaptation as a plan in more precise
  detail.  Again.
- Briefly looked through slides on classical planning to look for other
  ways to represent a plan, just in case.  Pointless and uninteresting.
- Re-read parts of http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~munoz/Publications/ReviewAdapt.pdf.
- Ok, finally realized:  Partial-Order planning and Hierarchical planning are
  *much* better ways to represent plans for case adaptation (so that adaptation
  doesn't involve gutter-level changes).  *FOR NOW*, I am going to use
  Total-Order planning (i.e. a plan is just an array of actions).  I should
  change this later to get more effective plans.
- Read what was available on Google preview of "Inside Case-Based Reasoning."
  Luckily, I found the call number for the book at the library.  Going to
  borrow it tonight, along with something just for fun.
